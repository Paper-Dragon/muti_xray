USING PASTEBIN.D FILES

Add a file in the "~/.pastebin.d", "/etc/pastebin.d", or XDG config or data
directories with the following format:

[pastebin]
basename = domain.name
post_page = api/post.php
paste_regexp = (.*)

[format]
reserved_keyword = pastebin_site_field
custom_keyword = pastebin_site_field

[defaults]
custom_keyword = value


THE PASTEBIN SECTION

Under "[pastebin]", you will want to keep the basic information to
identify the pastebin and set it up:

	basename	the generic domain name for the pastebin.
			this domain name should not contain
			possible sub-domains in use.

	post_page	used to specify a page to which to
			post data. it is the actual URL of
			the pastebin's form.

	paste_regexp	used to specify a regular expression to
			execute on the resulting page after posting.
			this is useful to deal with special
			pastebins that don't redirect you
			to the new paste's URL.

	target_page	used to compose the paste URL in combination
			with paste_regexp. the use of "%%s" as a
			placeholder e.g. for the paste ID is supported.

Furthermore, there are the self-explanatory "https", "post_format",
and "sizelimit" settings.


THE FORMAT SECTION

Under "[format]", identify the various fields in use in the pastebin you want
to set up. Identify any fields used to publish data on the pastebin, and add
them to the configuration file.

The "[format]" section expects reserved and custom keywords matched to the real
name for the field for the pastebin you are setting up. In other words, the
data that a reserved or custom keyword (the left-hand side) refers to will be
put in the named field assigned to it (the right-hand side).

A number of reserved keywords can be used, but are optional:

	user		contains the name of the user.

	content		contains the data that will be posted.

	title		contains the title if set at the command line.

	format		contains the format of the paste, usually
			used for syntax highlighting.

	jabberid	contains the jabberid of the poster.

	permatag	contains permatag as set at the command line.

	private		makes the paste private if supported.

	username	contains the pastebin username if required.

	password	contains the pastebin user's password if required.

Add any other fields in use for the specific pastebin you are setting up may be
added to the "[format]" section using the same syntax.

An easy way to deal with special parameters that need to be passed to the
pastebin, such as expiry time for a post, is to assign the pastebin's field
name to a variable, and set the correct value for that variable under the
"[defaults]" section later, as such:

[format]
expire = expiry

[defaults]
expire = 365

Where "expire" can then be reused as the keyword to retrieve a static value in
the "[defaults]" section. See below for an example.


THE DEFAULTS SECTION

The "[defaults]" section is used to set static values for custom fields.

Some pastebins require setting fields such as expiry time for posts, or
whether to use cookies. Such values are set using a custom field, followed by
the value to give it.

To reuse the example above, statically set a post to expire after 365 days:

[defaults]
expire = 365

Here, the value "365" will be assigned to the "expire" keyword. In the
"[format]" section, the value in the "expire" keyword is applied to the
field called "expiry".
